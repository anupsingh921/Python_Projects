# Python_Projects

This repository contains various Python projects that I have developed as part of my hands-on learning with Python. Each project demonstrates different aspects of Python programming and showcases my progress and understanding of various libraries and APIs.

### 1. Robo Speaker 
A simple Python application that converts text input from the user into verbal output.

**Features:**
- Takes text input from the user.
- Converts the text to speech and plays it aloud.

### 2. Weather Temperature Detector 
This project fetches weather data for various cities using an API and provides the current temperature of the city entered by the user.It uses the requests library to handle API calls.

**Features:**
- Accepts city name as input from the user.
- Fetches and speaks aloud the current temperature for the entered city using a weather API.

### 3.  Image Resizer 
An application that resizes images based on a user-provided scaling factor. It uses the cv2 module from OpenCV library to handle image processing tasks.

**Features:**
- Resizes images to a desired scale factor specified by the user.
- Outputs the resized image.

### 4.  MergePdf 
A utility that merges multiple PDF files into a single PDF document using the PyPDF2 library.
